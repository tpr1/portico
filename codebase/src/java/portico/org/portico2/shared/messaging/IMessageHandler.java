/**
 * A message handler is designed to consume and process {@link PorticoMessage} subclass objects,
 * performing any appropraite actions (whether that be doing nothing, tranforming the message
 * somehow, taking some action with the information contained within the message, filling out a
 * {@link ResponseMessage}, etc...).
 * 
 * <p/>
 * <b>Configuration</b>
 * <p/>
 * Message handlers are used in all the major infrastructure components of Portico architecture
 * (RTI, LRC, Fordwarder). When they are created, their {@link #configure(Map)} method will be
 * called, passing in references to critical other components depending on where they are running.
 * For example, if running inside an RTI, the RTI object itself will be passed, in addition to the
 * name of the federation that the handler is servicing.
 * <p/>
 * Each piece of configuration or component reference is bound under a specific ID, all of which
 * are declared as statics on this interface. Simply request the needed piece from the map, confirm
 * it isn't null and store it.
 *   
 * <p/>
 * <b>Other Support</b>
 * <p/>
 * <b>RECOMMENDED:</b> Unless you have an excellent reason, it is *STRONGLY* recommended that all
 * your message handlers extend one of the RTI/LRC specific handler classes that will provide
 * convenience methods to extract common components and cache them locally. 
 * <p/>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> All {@link IMessageHandler} implementations should have either <b>NO CONSTRUCTOR</b>
 * or a <b>PUBLIC, NO-ARG CONSTRUCTOR</b>. This is due to the fact that handler instances will
 * generally be created through reflection.
