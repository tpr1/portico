                  Welcome to the Portico Build System

       The Portico build system is an artefact-driven, modular, Ant
       based system. The base framework is split up over a number of
       different build files (base structure, macros, etc...) and is
       designed to be extended rather than modified. The full system
       is introduced and described in the online documentation:
